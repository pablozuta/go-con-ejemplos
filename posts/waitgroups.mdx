To wait for multiple goroutines to finish, we can use a wait group.

```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "sync"
    "time"
)

// This is the function we’ll run in every goroutine.
func worker(id int) {
    fmt.Printf("Worker %d starting\n", id)

    // Sleep to simulate an expensive task.
    time.Sleep(time.Second)
    fmt.Printf("Worker %d done\n", id)
}

func main() {

    // This WaitGroup is used to wait for all the goroutines launched here to finish.
    // Note: if a WaitGroup is explicitly passed into functions
    // it should be done by pointer.
    var wg sync.WaitGroup

    // Launch several goroutines and increment the WaitGroup counter for each.
    for i := 1; i <= 5; i++ {
        wg.Add(1)

        // Avoid re-use of the same i value in each goroutine closure.
        i := i

        // Wrap the worker call in a closure that makes sure 
        // to tell the WaitGroup that this worker is done. 
        // This way the worker itself does not have to be aware 
        // of the concurrency primitives involved in its execution.
        go func() {
            defer wg.Done()
            worker(i)
        }()
    }

    // Block until the WaitGroup counter goes back to 0; 
    // all the workers notified they’re done.
    wg.Wait()

}
// Note that this approach has no straightforward way to propagate errors from workers. 
```

```go
$ go run waitgroups.go
Worker 5 starting
Worker 3 starting
Worker 4 starting
Worker 1 starting
Worker 2 starting
Worker 4 done
Worker 1 done
Worker 2 done
Worker 5 done
Worker 3 done
```
The order of workers starting up and finishing is likely to be different for each invocation.
